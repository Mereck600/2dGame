Different version of the 121 final project using Jframe


Run this project using the generic run button. Tiles should be added to the res folder and then should be added to the TileManager -> getTileImage array and add settings to the tile depending on what it is. 
this is made using Jframe with JDK so make sure you have a JDk installed (if you followed the Eclipse install from hamid you should). 

I will finish this hopefully by 9/29 and then we can work on moving it over to processing and then adding more features.

Different version of the 121 final project using Jframe

here is the project: The tutorial i used to help me with this is [Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq)

Run this project using the generic run button. Tiles should be added to the res folder and then should be added to the TileManager -> getTileImage array and add settings to the tile depending on what it is. 
this is made using Jframe with JDK so make sure you have a JDk installed (if you followed the Eclipse install from hamid you should). 

I will finish this hopefully by 9/29 and then we can work on moving it over to processing and then adding more features.

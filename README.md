# 2dGame
## CSC 121 final project using Jframe

### To run:
Ensure you have the main package selected and press the run button in order to run the game.
To run the tile editor, select the tileEditor package and select the run Button.

### Latest Features:
-Revisied NPC and Object generation.
-Events: Now when a player steps on certain tiles or presses the enter key on these tiles an in-game event will occur. (NPC dialouge, Damage, Teleportation)
-New title screen with player selection (Not fully implemented)


Tiles should be added to the res folder and then should be added to the TileManager -> getTileImage array and add settings to the tile depending on what it is. 
this is made using Jframe with JDK so make sure you have a JDk installed (if you followed the Eclipse install from hamid you should).
